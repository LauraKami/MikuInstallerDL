To easily install MikuMikuDance and PMXEdidor with all dependencies and tools.

Miku_Installer works on Windows 10 and 11, 64-bit version. It installs dependencies and tools to use MikuMikuDance and PMX Editor.

You need 3 GB of free space for the software, and plan 50 GB to create animations and videos.

The software is downloaded to your PC, it comes from Microsoft, Bandizip, GitHub and Japanese sites for MikuMikuDance, MMEffect and PMX Editor.

Mostly, the downloads are automatic, but for some, you will have to help Miku download files…

If your PC is new, the installation is a bit long, because there are a lot of Microsoft software to install, and these are the most painful…

So, Miku Installer will offer you animation extracts and will make you discover magnificent MMDs.
